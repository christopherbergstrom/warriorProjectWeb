* * * * * *<br>Intro<br>* * * * * *<br><br>
The world was once divided into three giant cities, Berg, Rish, and Drade.<br>
The city of Berg was once strong. It had the most advanced military, its kings were strong and wise, and its wealth was above all others.<br>
Berg was the strongest city in world and would always aid the other cities in times of need.<br>
The other cities modeled themselves after Berg but they always fell short because of their leadership.<br>
The other two cities of the world were greedy and thought only of themselves.<br>
The kings of Berg passed down values of courage, selflessness and honor to their descendants and in doing so, won the love of their people.<br>
Berg stayed strong for centuries because of these things until the unexpected death of its most recent king.<br>
Rulers from the two other cities came and fought over the throne in an attempt to rule the great city, and once one of them finally triumphed, he ruled Berg the same way the other cities were.<br>
When the time came that the other cities needed help from Berg, they received no reply and they eventually fell to the darkness surrounding them.<br>
Soon the great city of Berg was on its own and started to crumble beneath incompetent rule and the surrounding darkness closing in. <br>

Welcome to the city of Berg warrior. I am very grateful that you are here.<br>
A number of terrifying creatures have begun to lay siege to our city, and while we have tried to hold them back, they have defeated all of our strongest soldiers.<br>
We are no longer able to protect ourselves and soon we will all be destroyed.<br>
You are our last hope.
